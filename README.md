# Welcome to my GitHub!

### My name is Jarret, I'm a software developer by trade and in my personal time!

I enjoy all things software, but have a particular interest in the following:
- The Internet of Things as it relates to manufacturing and logistics.
- Methods for processing large scale real-time datastreams for applications.
- Anything related to the process of developing "world-class software" this includes:
  - Leverage the latest in open-source software to develop applications.
  - Designing robust software systems that are easliy extended upon.
  - Software development processes such as Scrum and Agile methodologies.
  - Modern software continous integration and testing methodologies and technologies.
